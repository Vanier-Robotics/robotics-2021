This year through our robotics team we faced numerous challenges, the obvious one being, working solo, in many of our time-consuming projects. For the year 2021, through a google poll we voted on our theme, roman empire. The first couple of months we met 1-2 times weekly on Microsoft Teams where we discussed the layout and plan for our virtual kiosk. Here we spent between 1- and 2-hours brainstorming ideas and getting to know one another. Robotics has always been a way to make lifelong friends and develop great communication and teamwork skills. Unfortunately, this year we had to adapt to the new way of online meeting and learning which was very strange and unfamiliar to most of us, however, I believe as a team we did a decent job of communicating fluently to one another. Many of us also spoke out of robotics meetings and were able to discuss our ideas through group chats on Messenger.</p></div><div class="paragraph"> <p>One of the biggest challenges we had to face was figuring out a way to virtualize our kiosk. From this we used Blender in order to construct and present our ideas of what we wanted our Roman Empire to look like. Probably the biggest struggle was learning and trying to figure out the application “Blender”. This came with many hours of frustration and confusion, however, with practice and hard work came success. 2 members of the kiosk team also hand made and painted roman pillars to help with the video and help visualize what our kiosk would look like. Another problem we faced was communication issues, which I believe most teams had the same difficulty. It was hard getting on the same page as all members of the team and figuring out days where everyone could meet while we all juggled schoolwork, family time, and extra activities. Our Vanier Team did a good job with communication, yet we still struggled to meet deadlines.</p></div><div class="paragraph"> <p>For the design of the kiosk, we used the application “Blender”. As shown in the four angles of the kiosk at the bottom of the page, we can see all functionalities of our construction. When entering the kiosk our school’s name and number is presented on a colored flag. Our 4 columns help support our beams, but mostly represent our theme of Roman Empire. Behind the fake brick wall, we have a room which can be used for coats, shoes, and excess tools or materials. It is closed off with a cream-coloured curtain. A shelf system is placed in front with moving wheels for efficiency and extra organization space. To the left, our working table is used for our build team to make quick fixes, repair broken pieces, and set up our robot for the competition games. Above, it is a cork board to hang tools and supplies in order to save space and keep the working space organized. In the middle, we have a roman themed chest for aesthetic purposes, as well as to the right we have a stand for decorative purposes. Any extra space in our kiosk is used for efficient working and comfort. We tried our best to incorporate as many roman themed characteristics as well as following the kiosk guidelines and having a spacious efficient working space.</p></div><div class="paragraph"> <p><img class="image left full" src="/assets/images/articles/Picture1.jpg" alt="altText"/><img class="image left full" src="/assets/images/articles/Picture2.jpg" alt="altText"/><img class="image left full" src="/assets/images/articles/Picture3.jpg" alt="altText"/></p></div><div class="paragraph"> <p>After the crazy school year we had, we can confidently say we have met our expectations. I believe with the new challenges we had to overcome; we did a very good job at handling all the obstacles we were faced with. Although we were not able to properly meet and have access to all the materials needed to make a fully functional kiosk, with our creative brainstorming skills and dedication to making this year great, we did a wonderful job and should be proud of it!</p></div></div><div class="article" id="video"><h1 class="title">Video</h1><div class="paragraph"> <p>The video is one of the many components in this competition that is very fun to work on. Through the time that is spend on the creation of a video, we are able to hang out with our team and create memories. However, this year, our task was more difficult to achieve, considering the pandemic we find ourselves in. All of our meetings were done online, through computer screens, but we still tried to make the time we spend be of good use. Naturally, with this kind of change, our team fell behind; we faced many delays.</p></div><div class="paragraph"> <p>At the beginning of the CRC competition season, the video-making sub-team brainstormed as a group during online meetings. However, because of the many restrictions given by our government, no gathering could have been organized for the filming process. This being said, we decided that it would be best for the video to be a “one man show”; we changed our original idea to satisfy this. Filming was made difficult for a single team member, but was made easier since this member already owned many filming equipment—namely a greenscreen, a camera, and more. To make the video more interesting for the public, the actor had differing facial hair, clothing, and hairstyles.</p></div><div class="paragraph"> <p>Adding to this, throughout this journey, there were many difficulties for all team members. Time management for the actor and director was a challenge considering that schoolwork and deadlines kept pilling up. Communication was also difficult for all.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
