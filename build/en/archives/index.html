However, because of the many restrictions given by our government, no gathering could have been organized for the filming process. This being said, we decided that it would be best for the video to be a “one man show”; we changed our original idea to satisfy this. Filming was made difficult for a single team member, but was made easier since this member already owned many filming equipment—namely a greenscreen, a camera, and more.
